                    <h4>My First Project as a Developer</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Three months into my Software Engineering Program at ALX, I embarked on my first project as a developer, working remotely for a Nigerian startup developing an EdTech platform similar to Coursera. My role involved using JavaScript and TypeScript to create responsive user interfaces and secure back-end logic. This experience taught me the importance of clear communication in a remote setting, strengthened my coding skills, and provided valuable insights into real-world software development. It was a pivotal moment that solidified my passion for the field.</p>

                    <p>I've also dedicated time to learning HTML and CSS, and I am now very confident in using these technologies to build responsive, well-structured websites. My understanding of HTML and CSS allows me to create clean, efficient code and visually appealing designs.</p>

                    <p>In addition to front-end development, I've become proficient in Python and have honed my skills in Django development. So far, I've successfully created over 10 projects using Django, solidifying my expertise in building robust web applications with this powerful framework.</p>

                    <p>From this, you’ll see that I’m someone who takes the leap before I can talk myself out of doing something challenging.</p>

                    <p>After almost two years of supporting my system at the lab, I’m ready to learn something new. I'll be collaborating and sharing my experience with others on my blog (SayHelloWorld.co) and YouTube channel.</p>
                    <p>Aside from building small projects, I would love to enter a position where I can be part of a bigger team and learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
